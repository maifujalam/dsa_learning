Debug Pod to Pod Communication:-
1. test the Endponts betwenn two node.For tha use pod of calico-api server.This in range 192.168.0.0./16.
Master: curl -k https://192.168.219.66:5443/version
Worker: curl -k https://192.168.171.69:5443/version
Make sure that each endpoint gives successs form each node.

After endpoint gives,200.We are sure that the backend service is working as expected.

2. Now,test the cluster ip this is in range:-10.96.0.0/12.
   Cluster ip of calico-api server: curl -k https://10.110.50.85:443/version
   If the response is successful partually(1/number-of-nodes).Then its only able to successful to get 200
   from itself and unable to get 200 from other nodes.

3. RCA: In my case aws security group which connets to two VMs has only alllowd all TCP connectionbut not UDP.
        So I allows all trrafic from all port to self.
