    3. Network LB
    d. Gateway LB
4. Application Load balancer target group:-
    a. Instance
    b. IPAddress
    c. Lambda Functions
    d. Application Load Balancer
5. each subnet reserve 5 ip
6. each elb creation require at least 8 free ip to be present.
7. ELB dns name is xxx.region.elb.amazonaws.com.example in internet facing ALB.
8. Internet facing ALB,NLB requires route to internet gateway i.e, through public subnet.Does not work with route with NAT Gateway,i.e; private subnet.
9. NLB:- Layer-4,TCP or UDP,less latency ~ 100ms (vs ALB 400ms),
10. NLB:- One Static IP per AZ.Support assigning elastic IP.
11.NLB target Group- 1. EC2,ALB,Private IP Instances
12. Gateway Load balancer:- work with layer-3,single entry exit,Uses GENEVE protocol 6081.Its TG:- ec2,Private IP of DC.
13. Application Based Cookies:-
    Custom Cookies:- Generated by Target(USER),Don't use AWSALB,AWSALBAPP,AWSALBTG(Reserved by AWS)
    Application Cooke:- Generated by LB,Cooke name is AWSALBAPP
    Duration of cooke Specified by User.
14. Duration Based Cooke.
    It is generated by LB.Cooke name is AWSALB for ALB,AWSELB for CLB.
    Duration of cooke Specified by LB.
