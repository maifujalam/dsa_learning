1. iam_user@account_id_(or account id alias)
2. inline_policy: policy only attached to a user may or may not belong to group.
3. Multi factor authentication=> Virual MFA Device(Google Authenticator,Authy),YubiKey(like usb),Hardware Key Fob ,Surepass ID(for GovCloud)
4. AWS SDK is build on python named:- boto
5. Security Groups(SG)s are attached with AWS EC2 network interface.
6. when you download key.pem is permission is 0644 (Bad permission when used with ssh) -> chmod 0400 key.pem
7. Instance purchase criteria:-
    a.On-Demand Instance:- short workload,predictable pricing => high cost,bill per seconds (after first minute).Other then linux,windows /bill per hr.
    b.Reserved (Minimum 1 year ):- (1 or 3 year reserved,purchase with no,partial,all upfront(payment)),reserved vm type(no change)
        i. Reserved Instances: long workload (ex:- database) => 75% off
        ii.Convertable Reserved Instances:long workload with flexible instances ( chnage instance type) 54% off
        iii.Scheduled reserved Instance: Like every thursday from 10:00 AM to 12:00PM during pick hours.
    c. Spot Instance: short workload,cheap,can lose instance(less reliable).pto 90%,you can loose instance any time
       if your max price is less then current spot price( image process,batch job,data analysis,distributed workload,flexible work time).Not suitable for critic.
    d. Dedicated Hosts: book entire physical server.Required when compliance meet(data should stay in country),server bound software licence,3 year,expensive.

    a. Dedicated instance: charged per instance based but use dedicated host.

[Elastic Block Storage-EBS]
1. EBS are zonal based.
2. cannot connect ebs from one zone to another zone(zone lock).
3. One ebs connect to one instance at a time(instance lock).
4. vm can connect multiple ebs.
5. ebs can be moved to different az using snapshot.
6. ebs have delete on termination, which deletes on vm deletes.
7. default:-
    root volume ebs: deleted
    attached ebs:   not deleted
8. disable delete on termination if you want to preserve root volume after vm terminates
9.not compulsory to detach am ebs volume for snapshot but recommended.
10. snapshots:- a. same saze as ebs
                b. snapshot stored on region
                c. copy snapshot from one region to another
                d. create volume from snapshot (choose any az this time)
11. Types are: - standard(magnetic),gp2,gp3,io1,io2
12. Using EBS Multi-Attach, you can attach the same EBS volume to multiple EC2 instances in the same AZ. Each EC2 instance has full read/write permissions.

[Amazon Machine Iamage-AMI]
1. AMI is customization of EC2 instance.
2. AMI is region based but can be copied to other region.

[Elastic File System EFS]
1. Its a managed NFS workes which can be mounted on many EC2 (advantage over EBS)
2. EFS works with EC2 instances from multiple AZs. (advantage over EBS)
3. Highly Available,Scalable,expensive(3 * gp2 type),pay per use.
4. Use-case:- content management,web serving,word press,data sharing.
5. Based on NFS 4.1
6. Uses SECURITY GROUP to control access to EFS.
7. Compatible with Linux based AMI not Windows.
8. Encryption at rest by KMS.
9. Uses POSIX file system (i.e. Linux) that have standard API.
10. File system scales automatically,pay per use,no capacity planning required.
11. 1000+ of concurrent efs clients.zup to 10GB/S throughput.
12. Grow upto Petabyte ,so no planning of size required.
13. Different modes:-
    a. Performance modes:-
        General(web server,cms).
        MaxIO -high throughput ,parallel(big data,media processing).
    b. Throughput mode:-
        Bursting(In 1TB=50Mi/S + bursting uptp 100Mi/S)
        Provisioned: set throughput regardless of size(ex,1GBPS for 1TB)
14. Storage Tier (Move files after N days):-
    Standard:- For frequest file access.
    Infrequent Access(EFS-IA): low price to store but cost to retrieve file.
16. Steps to mount efs
    a. Require amazon-efs-utils: sudo yum install amazon-efs-utils -y
    b. Require efs directory: mkdir efs
    c. each subnet (where vm contains) should be in mount point of efs.
    d. It takes around 2-3 mins if you attach another subnet endpoint in efs.
    e. check mount status: df -hT
    f. Unmount: sudo umount efs
