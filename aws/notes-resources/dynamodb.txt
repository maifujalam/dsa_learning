1. Accelerate dynamodb read from Miliseconds to Microseconds:- DynamoDB Accelarator - DAX (in memory cache).
2. NoSQL databases are: mongodb and dynamodb.
4. Scales horizontally.
5. Made up of tables.Table have PRIMARY KEY(must be declared creation time).
6. Each table have infinite items(rows).
7. Each item  have attribution.(can be added later or null).
I8. Primary key choosing while database creation?
    Option-1(Partition Key): Partition key has to be unique throughout the table(ex:- user_id).
    Option-2(Primari Key): Partition key + Sort key(Hash+Range):
9. Table class:- Standard ,StandardIA
10. Capacity Calculator:
11. Capacity settings:-
    Provisioned:-Create in advance.
      A. Read Capacity: Autscaling present(minimum,maximum,target utilization-70%).
      B. Write Capacity: Auto-scaling present(minimum,maximum,target utilization-70%).
    Ondemand:-
       A. Automatic:- pay on actual usage.Auto scale read write capaacity. No capacity planning required.Higer cost.
    [Note: Mode switing can happen only after 24 hrs]
12. Encryption at rest is default and free.
13. Throughput can be exceeded temporarily through Burst Capacity.If burst capacity is also consumed then it will be ProvisionedThroughputExceededException.
14. Write Capacity Unit(WCU):-
    1. 1 WCU= 1 write/second for items upto 1KB size.
    2. Examples:-  a. Write 10 items/second of size 2 KB. Then WCU is 10 * (2/1) = 20 WCU
        b. Write 6 items / second with size 4.5 KB. Then 6*(5/1) = 30 WCU.
        c. 120 items/minute with size 2 kb. 120/60 * 2/1 = 4 WCU.

15. Strong Consistent Read:  If we just read after write we will get correct(non STALE) data but consume 2 * RCU. 
    Eventually Consistent Read(Default):- Read data after just write.Its possible to get STALE data.
