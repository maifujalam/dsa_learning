1. taint and toleration:
  kubectl taint nodes <node-name> key=value:<taint-effect>
  taint-effect : NoSchedule,PreferNoSchedule,NoExecute

2. how to remove taint from node:
  kubectl taint nodes <node-name> key:NoSchedule-

3. how to add toleration in pod yaml:
   spec:
      tolerations:
      - key: "key"
        operator: "Equal"
        value: "value"
        effect: "NoSchedule"

   spec:
      tolerations:
      - key: "cpu"
        operator: "Equal"
        value: "high"
        effect: "NoSchedule"

Node     CPU(virus type)	               Taint	Who can run?
Low	     cpu=low:NoSchedule	             Only lightweight pods that tolerate low CPU
Medium	 cpu=medium:PreferNoSchedule	   Medium workload pods can go here if no high CPU node is free
High	   cpu=high:NoSchedule	           CPU-intensive pods only

Pod Type	    Node Taints tolerated(vaccine)     	Behavior
Light	        low, medium, high	          Can go anywhere
Medium	      medium, high	              Avoid low CPU
High	        high	                      Must go high CPU

--
So Pod with low cpu should be having below:-
  - key: "cpu"
    operator: "Equal"
    value: "low"
    effect: "NoSchedule"
  - key: "cpu"
    operator: "Equal"
    value: "medium"
    effect: "PreferNoSchedule"
  - key: "cpu"
    operator: "Equal"
    value: "high"
    effect: "NoSchedule"
So it can go anywhere.

---
pod with medium cpu should be having below:-
  - key: "cpu"
    operator: "Equal"
    value: "medium"
    effect: "PreferNoSchedule"
  - key: "cpu"
    operator: "Equal"
    value: "high"
    effect: "NoSchedule"
So it can go medium and high cpu nodes.
---
pod with high cpu should be having below:-
  - key: "cpu"
    operator: "Equal"
    value: "high"
    effect: "NoSchedule"
So it can go only high cpu nodes.

4. node affinity:
  spec:
    affinity:
      nodeAffinity:
        requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution:
          nodeSelectorTerms:
          - matchExpressions:
            - key: disktype
              operator: In
              values:
              - ssd
              - nvme
        preferredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution:
        - weight: 1
          preference:
            matchExpressions:
            - key: another-node-label-key
              operator: In
              values:
              - another-node-label-value
