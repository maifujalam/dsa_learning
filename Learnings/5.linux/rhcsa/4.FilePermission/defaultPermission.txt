1. Permissions:-
    a. regular:- 3(rwx)
    b. special:- 3(setuid,setgid,stickybit)
        1. sticy(Only directory 1):- applicable only on directory,only owning user(owner of directory) can delete a file,chmod o+t,
            chmod 1NNN(chmod 1777),t:- stickbit+execute,T:-Only sticky bit no execution.(drwxrwxrwt)
        2. setgid(file+directory 2):- applicable file+dir,It sets newly created files primary group to file owners \
            primary group name.It targets on group part.chmod 2770 /data(drwxrws---), chmod g+s /dir or /file
            s:- gid is set + execute,S:- gid set only.
            Note:- hare chmod g+S does not work.
            chmod 3777 [3=1(stickybit)+2(setgid bit)]
        3. setuid(only file 4):- executable run only with the  permission of the owning user(owner of file) not the
             executer permission,chmod u+s,chmod 4NNN file_name,
             Example:- chmod 4NNN /usr/bin/tail
                        user1# tail 1 /etc/shadow (it shows output as tail is created by root,and now we are running tail
                         as root).
        4. Remove special permission:- chmod u-s example,chmod g-s,chmod o-t,chmod 00770 (hare extra 0 is used when
            removing special permission using octal number method).
        5. To enter into directory we need atleast execute permission.So chmod 2760 may not work as group have no
            execute permission.To Enter into the group dir,we need to do 2770.

2. Default permission:-
    a. folder: 777
    b. file: 666
3. After file is created it have wider permission,so to narrow it down we use umask.umask is used by both file and folder.
    a. Example: umask of 007 on file is 777-007=700 and file is 666-007=600 as negative value not allowed on file.
    b. But umask cotains special permission also(XNNN): Example:-0777.
    c. umask: 0022 (means when new folder is created it will have 0777-0022=0755 and file is 0666-0022=0644).
    d. Default umask on vanilla linux is 0000.
    e. Change default umask: umask 0000
    f. Umask value only persist on default session.If ssh breaks umask sets back to 0022.
4. Global login script for the system is /etc/bashrc.So thange default umask value,make change in bashrc.
5. Check the permission of directory: ls -ld /tmp/shared
6, get members of group: getent group techdocs
7. user:u,group:g,others:o,all:a
