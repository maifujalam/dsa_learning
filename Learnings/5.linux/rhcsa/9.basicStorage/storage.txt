1. lsblk: list available storage devices
2. Mount a devise to a location: mount /dev/sad1 /mnt/data
3. List full device path and usage: lsblk -pf [f:full UUID,) p:path /dev/sda1,/dev/sad2]
4. Can we mount devide by UUID?
   mount UUID="11..aa" /mnt/data1
5. Where the USB is usually mounts? /run/media
6. How to unmount? umount /mnt/data1 [ path where device is mounted]
7. What is inode?
  - inode is Index Node
  - It stores the metadata of the file.
  - stat <file_name>
  - An inode does NOT store the file name or actual data, but it contains:
    - file type (file,dir,link)
    - timestamo (created,modified,accessed)
    - size
    - permission
    - UID,GID
8. how to find free inode number?
  df -hiT [disk free]
9. Find a file using inode number? find ~ -inum 72670210
10. How to find the process which is using a given file system? lsof /mnt/dat1
11. Cannot unmount a dir from that dir path.You have to go out of that dir first.
12. What is MBR (Master Boot Record)partition scheme?
  - Its a old partition scheme
  - It present on the syatem that have BIOS firmware.
  - It is slow and support upto 4 partition.
  - It can have disk size of upto 2 TB.(32 bit partition side).

13. What is GPT (GUID[Globally Unique Identifier ] Partition Table) partition scheme?
  - It uses UEFI (Unified Exteded Firmware Interface)
  - It provides max 128 partitions.
  - Max size 8 ZiB (Zebibyte or 1024 TB).
  - GPT partition is mostly at the first partition table and size os 100MB.Backup at the end(optional).
13. Whats a firmware?
   Its a piecle of software that stores at non volatile momory ROM of motherboard.USed to boot up os.

14. How to edit a partition ? parted command
15. partition new disk sdb ? parted /dev/sdb
16. Difference between 1GB and 1 GiB? 1GB=1000MB 1GiB=1024 MiB
17. How to partition a disk?
    a. Distinguish the disk type MBR or GPT.
       $ parted /dev/sdb mklabel gpt [or msdos for MBR]
    b. Create new partition of 200 MiB: parted /dev/sdb mkpart primary xfs 2048s 200MiB (parted /dev/sdb help mkpart)
     [Important note: When you specify a filesystem type like xfs or ext4 in parted, it does not actually create
     the filesystem.It only sets a partition type label. This label is just metadata and does not format the partition.
    c. Format the new partition by creating a file system: mkfs.xfs /dev/sdb1 [ lsblk to get the new block name ]
    d. Mount to fstab: /mnt/p1
      - mkdir -pv /mnt/p1
      - mount /dev/sdb1 /mnt/p1
      - Verify if its mountes: mount | sdb1
     e. Create permanent entry: UUID="uuid of /dev/sdb1" /mnt/p1 defaults 0 0
     f. mount: mount -a [a:all]
     g. check the status: du -hiT [h: human i: inodes T: Type]
    [Note: to remeber it like: mk[label,part,fs]

18. What is 2048s in partitioning?
  Legacy MBR (Master Boot Record) reserves the first 512 bytes (sector 0) for the bootloader.
  And GPT uses 100 Mi.
  We are allocating 2048 sectors (1 MB) for boot loader.
  Most disks uses 512-byte as 1 sector size.So 2048s * 512-byte=1MiB

19. Whats the usual size of boot loaders?
  MBR: 446 bytes (inside the first 512 bytes of the disk)
  GPT: Its 100MiB.Thats why 100 MB is resereved at 1st sector of boot device.

20. How to delete a partition?
   - Unmount the partition: umount /mnt/p1
   - Delete the partition: parted /dev/sdb rm 1

21. Create swap partition of 300MB on /dev/sdc with partition type GPT.
  a. Label disk as GPT: parted /dev/sdc mklabel gpt [verify:  parted /dev/sdc print ]
  b. Create swap partition: parted /dev/sdc mkpart primary linux-swap 2048s 300MiB
  c. Format a swap: mkswap /dev/sdc1
  d. Mount a swap partition:
    UUID="" swap swap defaults 0 0
  e. Reload daemon: systemctl daemon reload


1. Create a new partition on /dev/sdb of size 500MiB with GPT partition type and format it as ext4 file system. Then mount it to /mnt/data permanently.
   a. parted /dev/sdb mklabel gpt
   b. parted /dev/sdb mkpart p1 ext4 1MB 500MB [ here 2048s is for boot loader ] or mkpart primary ext4 1MiB 500MiB
   c. mkfs.ext4 /dev/sdb1
   d. mkdir -pv /mnt/sdb1
   e. mount /dev/sdb1 /mnt/sdb1
   f. Get UUID: lsblk -pf
   g. Edit fstab: UUID="uuid_of_sdb1" /mnt/data ext4 defaults 0 0
   h. mount -a
   i. Verify: findmnt | grep sdb1
   j. Get metadata: tune2fs -l /dev/sdb1
   h. After cehcing the free space: Its found that  only 397/500 MB is usable as reserved space is there for super user by default 5% of total space.
      1. Ext4 reduces 500MB-> 430MB usable space for normal user. [ This is around 15% of 500MB]
      2. 5% reserve for root + metadata reduced usable to ~397M [ This is around 20% of 500MB]
    i. To change it to 1%: tune2fs -m 1 /dev/sdb1

    Tip: mklabel-> mkpart -> mkfs -> mount -> fstab -> mount -a -> verify -> tune2fs

2. Extend the partition /dev/sdb1 by 500MiB.
   a. unmount /mnt/data
   b. Safely reduce file system size: resize2fs /dev/sdb1 500M [ new_size= old_size - 500MiB]
   b. parted /dev/sdb print [ to get the last sector of sdb1]
   c. parted /dev/sdb rm 1
   d. parted /dev/sdb mkpart p1 ext4 1MiB 1048MB [ new_last_sector= old_last_sector + 200MiB]
   e. e2fsck -f /dev/sdb1 [ to check file system,Important step ]
   g. mount -a
   h. Verify : df -h /mnt/data

   Tip: To shrink give the 300MB.But its not recomended.
        DO not format the partition again after resizing.Only run: resize2fs /dev/sdb1
