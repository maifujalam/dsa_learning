1. Identifiers:-process by ProcesssID(PID),Users by UserID(UID),Groups GroupID(GID),Files are Index Nodes(INods).
2. Inode:- Hodes metadata about file.
3. INode is created for every file with 512 Byte contains:- permission,ownership,date timestamp.It does not keep
    track of the name of the file.
4. File name is the responsibilty of File Allocation table.
5. File allocation table(FAT) contains file name maped with Inode of that file.
6. To display file inode:-  ls -li
    8583 -rw-r--r--. 1 vagrant vagrant 0 Nov 10 06:57 hello_world   [ Hare 8583 is file INode.Hare 1 means no of link
     count.So link count tells how many names are associated with that INode]
7.If two files have same INode then they have same metadata.
8. Create hard link:-
    ln hello_word rl
    ln dir1 dir2 [hard link in directory does not work]
9. ls -althri:-
    8583 -rw-r--r--. 2 vagrant vagrant 3 Nov 10 09:20 hello_world
    8583 -rw-r--r--. 2 vagrant vagrant 3 Nov 10 09:20 rl
    Hare having same INode number,and 2 specifies it have two name with same INode.
10. If removed the original file:-
    a. For hard link:- Is not broken and persist data.
    b. For softlink:- Its becomes broken link.Files conenets are also missing.
11. If you touch the hard link file then :-
    a. It does not over ride the file.
    b. Its(hard link files) meatada like:- date time is updated.
    c. Also actual file's metadata is updated.
