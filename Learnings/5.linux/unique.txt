1. What is unique?
   print uniqe line from stdin.So,if next line have same data then it wll print blank over there.
   It only detects unique in adjacent lines.So if it doesnt detect duplicate if its not adjacent.
   To detect adjacent use:- sort -u file2.txt

2. Print duplicate count?
   uniq -c file2.txt

3. Only print lines which are adjacent repeted ( i.e upcoming line or next line is same?
   uniq -d uniq_1.txt

4. Print only uniq lines(i.e line whose above and below are different).
    uniq -u uniq_1.txt

5. Find uniq with ignoring case sensitive?
    uniq -i uniq_1.txt
