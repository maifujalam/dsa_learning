      - Detailed view (Recort type,location)

6. Show the live statistics of number of transaction sent and recived by interface eth1?
  ip -s link show eth1

  3: eth1: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 1500 qdisc fq_codel state UP mode DEFAULT group default qlen 1000

7. How to check the route table?
  ip route

  [root@server1 vagrant]# ip route
  default via 10.0.2.2 dev eth0 proto dhcp src 10.0.2.15 metric 100 (Rule-3)
  10.0.2.0/24 dev eth0 proto kernel scope link src 10.0.2.15 metric 100  (Rule-2)
  192.168.56.0/24 dev eth1 proto kernel scope link src 192.168.56.11 metric 101 (Rule-1)

  Rule-1
  All packets that are destined for network 192.168.56.0 are sent directly through ethernet eth1 gateway 192.168.56.11
  as its directly connected to that network.

  Rule-2:
  All packets that are destined for network 10.0.2.0/24 are sent through gateway 10.0.2.15 of ethernet eth0 as its
  directly connected to this network.

  Rule-3:
  All other packets are sent to default gateway 10.0.2.15 through eth0.As its a nat gateway its doing SNAT to intenet.

8. How to trace the hops?
   tracepath jenkins.maifuj.com
   ubuntu@bastion:~$ tracepath jenkins.maifuj.com
    1?: [LOCALHOST]                      pmtu 9001
    1:  ip-172-31-0-1.ap-south-1.compute.internal             0.220ms pmtu 1500
    1:  no reply
    2:  ec2-43-204-44-159.ap-south-1.compute.amazonaws.com    1.681ms reached
    [ here serial no 2 means 2nd hop its resolved]

9. Check port associated with service?

    sudo ss -tap [t: tcp a:all p:process]

10. How to use cli to configure network?
    a. check device status: nmcli dev status
    b. add new connection:
    sudo nmcli connection add con-name sip type ethernet ifname eth1 ipv4.addresses 192.168.56.20 ipv4.gateway 192.168.56.11
    here remember the order: connection name,connection type,interface,ipv4 address,ipv4 gateway,autoconenct yes (optional)
    c. modify a connection:
     - nmcli connection show
     - add connection property: nmcli connection modify sip +ipv4.dns 1.1.1.1
       delete connection property: sudo nmcli connection modify sip connection.autoconnect no
       Override connection property: sudo nmcli connection modify sip ipv4.addresses 192.168.56.21
    d. delete ca connection: nmcli connection delete sip
    e. Config file path: sudo vi /etc/NetworkManager/system-connections/sip.nmconnection [then do nmcli conne reload]
    f. restart interface: nmcli connection down eth1 && nmcli connection up eth1

11. Set hostname :  hostnamectl set-hostname abc (
12. get hostname: hostnamectl
13. What are the diffferent types of hostname:-
