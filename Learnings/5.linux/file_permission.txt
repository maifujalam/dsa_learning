1.What are linux file permissions:
  standard: rwx
  special: Special file permissions:-
    a. set uid: u+s
    b. set giu: g+s
    c. set sticky bit:o+t
    [usgsot] -> sst

2. What is SUID[u+s]?
  - When a file with SUID is executed, it runs with the owner's privileges instead of the user's.
  - Example:- /bin/passwd, where a normal user can change their password, but the file runs as root.
  [root@master vagrant]# ls /bin/passwd -al
  -rwsr-xr-x. 1 root root 32648 Aug 10  2021 /bin/passwd
  - Example to set uuid: chmod u+s /path/to/file [ to remove u-s ]

3. What is GUID[g+s]?
  - If set on a file, it runs with the group's privileges.Example: chmod g+s /path/to/file
  - If set on a directory, all new files created inside inherit the group ownership.
  - Example: Shared folder.
    mkdir shared
    chmod g+s shared

4. What is sticky bit?
   - If set on a directory, only the owner of a file inside that directory can delete or modify it.
   - Commonly used in /tmp, where multiple users have access, but they cannot delete each other's files.
